# Problem Statement - Uber Data Analysis

## Context
Uber Technologies, Inc. is an American multinational transportation network company based in San Francisco and has operations in approximately 72 countries and 10,500 cities. In the fourth quarter of 2021, Uber had 118 million monthly active users worldwide and generated an average of 19 million trips per day.

Ridesharing is a very volatile market and demand fluctuates wildly with time, place, weather, local events, etc. The key to being successful in this business is to be able to detect patterns in these fluctuations and cater to demand at any given time.

As a newly hired Data Scientist in Uber's New York Office, you have been given the task of extracting insights from data that will help the business better understand the demand profile and take appropriate actions to drive better outcomes for the business. Your goal is to identify good insights that are potentially actionable, i.e., the business can do something with it.

## Objective
To extract actionable insights around demand patterns across various factors.

## Key Questions
1. What are the different variables that influence pickups?

2. Which factor affects the pickups the most? What could be plausible reasons for that?

3. What are your recommendations to Uber management to capitalize on fluctuating demand?

## Guidelines
1. Perform univariate analysis on the data to better understand the variables at your disposal.

2. Perform bivariate analysis to better understand the relationships between different variables.

3. Create visualizations to explore data and extract the insights.
